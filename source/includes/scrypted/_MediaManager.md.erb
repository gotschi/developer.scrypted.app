> User Script Code

```ecmascript
// In a script that uses a speaker, send a text string to the speaker for playback.
const text = sdk.createMediaObject(Buffer.from('The front door is open'), 'text/plain');
speaker.load(text);
```

> Speaker Plugin Code

```ecmascript
// In a different plugin that implements the speaker, convert the text string to a
// publicly accessible audio/wav Uri.
// "media" is the "text" MediaObject from above.
var mediaUrl = await sdk.convertMediaObjectToUri(media, "audio/wav");
playUrl(mediaUrl);
```

MediaObjects are an interstial representation of any media that flows through the Scrypted platform. Devices generally
are not concerned about the source type of the media, but need the media to be converted into
a type is compatible with the device. For example, a user may want to send text to a speaker for playback.
The speaker is not aware of the source media type, and only needs it to be converted into an audio url.
