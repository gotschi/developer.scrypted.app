# Core Concepts

<aside class="notice">
Devices are a core object of a home automation platform, and have two main properties: Interfaces and Events.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are how devices expose their capabilities to Scrypted. An OnOff interface represents a binary switch. The Brightness
interface represents a light that can be dimmed. The ColorSettingRgb interface indicates the light can change color.
A device may expose multiple different interfaces to describe its functionality.

For example, given the following devices, the interfaces they would implement:

* Outlet: [OnOff](#onoff),
* Dimmer Switch: [OnOff](#onoff), [Brightness](#brightness),
* Color Bulb: [OnOff](#onoff), [Brightness](#brightness), [ColorSettingRgb](#colorsettingrgb)

Interfaces aren't only used represent characteristics of physical devices. As mentioned, they provide ways to hook into Scrypted.
The [HttpRequestHandler](#httprequesthandler) lets you add a web hook to handle incoming web requests. [EventListener](#eventlistener)
lets you create handlers that respond to events. [DeviceProvider](#deviceprovider) acts as a controller platform (like Hue or Lifx) for
exposing multiple other devices to Scrypted.

Interfaces also provide a way to query the device state. Such as checking whether an outlet is on or off, the current brightness level,
or the current color.

## Events

Events are how devices notify Scrypted when something has changed on their interface. For example, when a light turns on,
the Light device would send an OnOff event. If a Slack message is received, the Slack device would send a [MessagingEndpoint](#messagingendpoint)
event. Setting a schedule for sunrise on weekdays would send an [Alarm](#alarm) event on that schedule.

Automations can subscribe tp these events and your smart home can be customized to react accordingly.

Like device interfaces, a device can be a source for as many events as it wants. For example, the table of events for a given device:

* Simple Bulb: [OnOff](#onoff),
* Dimmable Bulb: [OnOff](#onoff), [Brightness](#brightness),
* Color Bulb: [OnOff](#onoff), [Brightness](#brightness), [ColorSettingRgb](#colorsettingrgb)

While this looks exactly the same as above, note that this isn't always the case. The [HttpRequestHandler](#httprequesthandler)
interface, for example, has no corresponding event.
